# e-election
-The project focuses on developing a mobile application for the Election system.
-By having an online election system,the polling percentage will raise as everyone can vote from home or office or from anywhere under the blue sky.
-All the eligible voters are allowed to register in the app for the first time and their identity is verified by sending a verification code linked with their voter id.
-Once registered,all the registered users will get an encrypted token before the day of election,and periodic notifications will be sent to them on the day of election to remind them.
-On election day,users could be given a deadline of 24 hours to cast their vote using the received token and once a token is used,it becomes invalid.
-After voting,they could actually check whether their vote has been casted correctly,thus providing a transparency to the voters.
